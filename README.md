# Bank_System
C++ program is to simulate a simple customer queue management system using a queue in C++. It's like a basic system for a bank or customer service center where:  Customers join a queue (are added).  They are served in the order they arrived (first-come, first-served).  You can add, remove, or display all customers currently in the system.
